# NODEMCU---Car-Heater
Final Project of INF1350(PUC RIO): using love2d and NODEMCU i'm simulating a car heater. More description in the comments of code files.

Remember: first turn ON, on visual code the station file, then the testemqtt file after we see an IP conection on NODEMCU-Tools console.

ps: CH340 Extension can help with "NODEMCU TOOLS EXTENSION" problems on visual code.
